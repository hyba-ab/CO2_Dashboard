Dashboard Title: Global CO2 Emissions and Climate Change 
Purpose:
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of global CO2 emissions and their correlation with climate change. It utilizes Python's "Panel" and "hvPlot" libraries to create interactive visualizations that allow for easy exploration and analysis of the data.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Panel
hvPlot

Dashboard Components:
CO2 Emissions by Continent: A line chart showing CO2 emissions trends for different continents.
CO2 Source by Continent: A bar chart comparing CO2 emissions from various sources (e.g., coal, oil, gas) across continents.
CO2 Emissions and GDP per Capita: A scatter plot exploring the relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP per capita.
Interactive Filters: Allow users to filter data based on specific criteria (e.g., year, continent).
